# Bar-plot-in-python

Decided I would make use of my data I acquired in the last 3 semesters of college and
so I made a bar plot of how much time I have invested in each subject at my college(yes I measure this stuff).

I'm expecting to gain some interesting insights, that I didn't knew before. 

The subjects data is stored in .csv file.
Also I colored bars based on if I have passed or failed the subject so far.
