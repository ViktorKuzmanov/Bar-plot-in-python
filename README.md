# Data-analysis-with-python

1. bar plot of time invested in subjects.py = Just a bar plot of hours learned at each subject and colored bar based on if I have failed the subject or not

2. linearFitOfHoursLearnedAndGrades.py = Hours learned and grades data in a graph with their linear fit. 
Turns out those 2 attributes (hours learned and grades) don't have like any correlation at all, dunno what's wrong with my learning style.
